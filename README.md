# Frontend Nanodegree Neighborhood Map Project

This is project five in Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. The aim of this project was to develop a single page application using Knockout.js, Google Maps API and another third-party API. The app should display map markers for at least 5 destinations within a chosen neighbourhood, a filter, and further information on the locations via infowindows or DOM elements.

My project features several wet weather entertainment options for children in Vienna, Austria. Location information is retrieved asnychronously from Foursquare when the user either clicks on the Google Map Marker or venue name. Users can filter through the list of attractions by name and can use the enter key to navigate to the map if the search query returns a match.

If a response error occurs from either the Foursquare API or Google Maps API, the app still provides basic information about the destinations via external links or hard-coded data.

All application components can be used on mobile, tablet and on desktop.

This project was build using Gulp.

## Getting started

First go to the master branch of the project and get a copy of the repository by either downloading the project files to your computer or via the command line.

` https://github.com/LeaSak/Neighbourhood_Map`

To view the app, go to the project's **dist** directory, and open **index.html** in your browser. So far it's only been tested in Google Chrome.

All development files are located in the **src** directory.
